Outlets provides a set of functions which validate that `IBOutlets` are
correctly connected between your Storyboard/XIB file and view controller properties. It
can also validate that `IBAction` methods are connected correctly as well.

For an explanation of the approach and how these assertions work see
[Testing IBOutlets and IBActions With Curried Functions in Swift](http://phatbl.at/2016/04/29/testing-iboutlets-and-ibactions-with-curried-functions-in-swift.html)

The standalone
[OutletActionAssertion](https://github.com/phatblat/OutletActionAssertion)
project demonstrates how they work.
